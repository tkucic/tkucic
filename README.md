## Featured portfolio projects

### OSCAT LIB PORT FOR B&R AUTOMATION STUDIO

![BR_OSCAT_LIB](https://github.com/tkucic/brOscatLib/blob/main/logo.png)

This repo is a port of the popular Oscat lib to the B&R Automation studio platform. The library contains all functions and function blocks that are in OscatBasic 3.34, Oscat building 1.00 and the Oscat network 1.35.2 library. At the moment, the libraries are a work in progress, the main programmatic porting has been going well. Depending on the ammount of contributers the library will be ported to completion. Initial port was done from Codesys plc open xml export.

### PLC GARDEN CONTROLLER

![GARDEN_CTRL](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_garden_controller/blob/master/screenshot.gif)

Automated gardening at its best. This is a portfolio project that features a simulator and a controller of four gardens holding 25 flowers/plants each. Each garden has a watering platform system moved by servo motors. In this project the user can learn how to control servo motors, optimize instruction/path algorithms and generally learn how to program PLCs.

You can try and make your own watering algorithm that will keep ALL of the flowers alive. --> [REPO](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_garden_controller)

### PLC TRAFFIC CONTROL

![TRAFFIC_CTRL](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_traffic_control/blob/master/screenshot.gif)

Traffic control is often used a simple introduction into sequencing when programming PLCs. As a part of my portfolio I have written a simple timing controller and a simulator for two crossroads that are one way streets with pedestrians going in all directions. The project is meant for begginers and for educational purposes. It is published under MIT license. Written in CODESYS 3.5 and in structured text language.

You are welcome to try to control it yourself! It is harder than it looks. --> [REPO](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_traffic_control)

### PLC HELLO MIXING TANK

![MIXING_TANK](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_hello_mixing_tank/blob/master/screenshot.gif)

In industrial automation the "hello world" program is a mixing tank. As a part of my portfolio I have written a simple mixing tank controller and a simulator. The project is meant for begginers and for educational purposes. It is published under MIT license. Written in CODESYS 3.5 and in structured text language.
