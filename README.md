# Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**"For me, what drives me, is all things electric and automated. I cannot imagine myself doing anything else."**

I have been working as an Electrotechnical officer onboard the largest container ships in the world where I learnt how shipboard systems work in practice. That knowledge improved my automation designing and programming skills later on in my carreer. Because of this I can provide unique experience from the operators and designers point of view, bridging the gap.

In recent years I have been working with Power control automation products, building them from the ground up or improving the maintainance processes of existing products using Scrum and Lean Six Sigma methodologies.

I am also a Python programmer so decision support with data analysis and automation assisted product development are my main points of interest.

## Featured portfolio projects

### OSCAT LIB PORT FOR B&R AUTOMATION STUDIO

This repo is a port of the popular Oscat lib to the B&R Automation studio platform. The library contains all functions and function blocks that are in OscatBasic 3.31 library.

Join the project here --> [REPO](https://github.com/tkucic/brOscatLib)

### PLC GARDEN CONTROLLER

![GARDEN_CTRL](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_garden_controller/blob/master/screenshot.png)
Automated gardening at its best. This is a portfolio project that features a simulator and a controller of four gardens holding 25 flowers/plants each. Each garden has a watering platform system moved by servo motors. In this project the user can learn how to control servo motors, optimize instruction/path algorithms and generally learn how to program PLCs.

You can try and make your own watering algorithm that will keep ALL of the flowers alive. --> [REPO](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_garden_controller)

### PLC TRAFFIC CONTROL

![TRAFFIC_CTRL](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_traffic_control/blob/master/screenshot.png)
Traffic control is often used a simple introduction into sequencing when programming PLCs. As a part of my portfolio I have written a simple timing controller and a simulator for two crossroads that are one way streets with pedestrians going in all directions. The project is meant for begginers and for educational purposes. It is published under MIT license. Written in CODESYS 3.5 and in structured text language.

You are welcome to try to control it yourself! It is harder than it looks. --> [REPO](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_traffic_control)

### PLC HELLO MIXING TANK

![MIXING_TANK](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_hello_mixing_tank/blob/master/screenshot.png)
In industrial automation the "hello world" program is a mixing tank. As a part of my portfolio I have written a simple mixing tank controller and a simulator. The project is meant for begginers and for educational purposes. It is published under MIT license. Written in CODESYS 3.5 and in structured text language.

Try mixing your own hre --> [REPO](https://github.com/tkucic/plc_hello_mixing_tank)
